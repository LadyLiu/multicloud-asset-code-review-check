# Directions
For this exercise, please review the following methods in the `s3_utils.py` and `test_s3_utils.py` files:
`_get_byte_offsets_and_parts`
`_large_copy_object_to_aws`
`_upload_part_to_aws`

This code was intentionally designed for interview purposes -- so fear not, you won't offend anyone!

***Criteria:***
- These methods are part of a multicloud solution intended to decrease costs of transferring assets across regions.
- Please do not spend time independently validating or invalidating the math for any of the methods, as thatâ€™s beyond the intent of this exercise.
- Please review the methods and included tests. We are looking for technical communication that happens asynchronously, thinking through technical problems, and clarification where information is not complete.
- This code was intentionally modified for interview purposes -- so fear not, you won't offend anyone!
